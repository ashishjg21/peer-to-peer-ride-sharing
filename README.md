## Peer-To-Peer Ride Sharing Platform

## The problem it solves

First of all its eliminates pollution caused by gas powered vehicles.
Secondly, This platform allows users to rent a car for a small period of time in affordable cost.
Thirdly, Users are able to earn some money from sharing their cars when they do not need them.
Furthermore, we are not forced to buy a car what significantly reduces our living and maintenance costs.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the most challenging things that we had to do was bug fix the incredibly complicated Smart Contract backend. There was so much undocumented features that we had to pratically invent from scratch, in terms of Solidity concepts. We also had to deal with the very very very bad error handling. Node and Solidity EVM errors were extremely vague and thus difficult to diagnose. Also, the infrastructure itself was a huge pain to keep track of and build. There were so many components and processes going on that we had to really focus on to make sure it all worked together. I highly recommend looking at the Git Repo and checking the contracts (Main.sol) as well as the routes folder to just see how comedical the amount of features and processes we had.
